			<h3>What is mood?</h3>
			<p>
				Mood is a webapp, currently in early alpha, that is being developed in order to make it easier to be mindful of your emotional state. By keeping track of how you feel at certain times and with different metrics, you can learn how to keep yourself in good spirits.
			</p>
			<h3>Why are you developing this?</h3>
			<p>
				I am passionate about mental health and I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"> cognitive behavioral therapy </a> as a way of treatment. Part of my CBT regimine is mindfulness of my emotional state, so recording my mood is important. I've been playing around with in my head for more than a year since recording these things on pen and paper is nice, but I can't apply all the amazing statistics I have planned on pen and paper. If I can help even one person beyond with this app then every bit of work I put into it will be worth it.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also wanted to learn Django and this seemed like a great way to do so. Achievement get: Become Full Stack Developer! You can learn more about the technical side of this project <a href="http://marcelli.ca/projects/mood-tracker.html">here</a>
			</p>
			<h3>So who are you?</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="http://marcelli.ca/about/">My name is Lucas Marcelli.</a> I like coding and cats and space. I am a software developer fresh out of school and I have Anxiety and Depression. If you ever need someone to talk to, email me whenever.
			</p>
			<h3>Can I help development?</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="https://github.com/lucasmarcelli/mood-tracker">Yasssssss!</a> Fork and make a PR, once I pull a couple in I'll add you as a contributor!
			</p>
			<h3>Does this cost anything?</h3>
			<p>
				Nope, and I will never make it cost anything. It barely costs me anything to host right now and if it ever get's expensive I will probably open a donation page or something but I want this to be a tool for anyone.
			</p>
			<h3>Will you sell my Data?</h3>
			<p>
				Nope. I recognize that this data could be extremely valuable to marketers but there is a level of trust that I feel I have to keep with my users because of the sensitive nature of this data. Maybe in the far future I could make it an opt-in option to allow me to include (anonymized) data of yours in a package I sell. Regardless, it will be transparent and if you want to delete your account should that day come, I will <b>not</b> store a backup of your data.
			</p>
			<h3>Are you working with doctors?</h3>
			<p>
				Kind of. I have talked with my Psychiatrist and he has given his opinions. He thinks it's a wonderful idea and I am definitley going to be researching and reaching out to as many doctors as possible. I'd love to integrte some sort of doctor portal one day where all the stats will be availible to the doctors of patients who use this.
